Exercise 1: Create a function that takes in a 1D numpy array as input and returns the indices of the top n values in the array, where n is an integer input to the function.
Input: [5, 3, 1, 2, 4], n=3
Expected Output: [0, 4, 1]

Exercise 2: Create a function that takes in a 1D numpy array as input and returns the difference between the largest and smallest values in the array.
Input: [2, 5, 1, 7, 3]
Expected Output: 6

Exercise 3: Create a function that takes in a 1D numpy array as input and returns a new array where each value is replaced with the average of the value and its neighboring values.
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Expected Output: [1.5, 2, 3, 4, 4.5]

Exercise 4: Create a function that takes in a 2D numpy array as input and returns the row and column indices of the maximum value in the array.
Input: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
Expected Output: (2, 2)

Exercise 6: Create a function that takes in a 2D numpy array and returns a new array where each value is the sum of the values in its corresponding diagonal.
Input: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
Expected Output: [15, 15]

Exercise 9: Create a function that takes in two 2D numpy arrays as input and returns a new array where each value is the minimum value between the corresponding values in the two input arrays.
Input: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], [[9, 8, 7], [6, 5, 4], [3, 2, 1]]
Expected Output:
[[1 2 3]
[4 5 4]
[3 2 1]]
